Cheating for an online game

Not revealing which game it is for. Since I still cannot win I assume I am not the only one cheating ;)

Usage:
> ./wl.py

Will download a word list the first time it is run. I have not included the wordlist because of unknown copyright. Wait for "Listening".
> ./do.py <16 letters>
